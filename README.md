WHAT IS AUTOUPDATE-BRIDGE?

This particular project came out of wanting to find a way to have code displayed on one screen or device (in my case a mobile device that was connected to a prop computer) that could be amended and altered via another device.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

To make this work you need to have a GitHub account of your own. These are fairly straight forward to create and a search on YouTube will give you a walkthrough of setting up your own account. 
Once you have an account you need to create a repository and have that repository as a Static Web Hosting page. 
Instructions for how to do this can be found at :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XhxR9Vs6zc&t=123s&pp=ygUVZ2l0aHViIHBhZ2VzIHR1dG9yaWFs 

Essentially, as long as your computer code is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only then this can be hosted at a static web address.
If you follow the above YouTube instructions, this will be: 

https://YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME.github.io


WHAT IS THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF CODE FOR? WHAT 'IC NEED' DOES IT FULFIL?

  "You have managed to sneak past the security guard and get into the server room. In the few minutes you have you need to create a backdoor into the system through which you can work.
  Taking out your portable device you insert a datacable into the back of it which leads to a USB plug. This USB you then insert into the target device. 
  On your portable device you navigate to the web address you have memorised and the screen flashes up with the expected welcome message. 
  After a brief pause, the code runs and the screen starts to scroll with data.

  Now you just need to wait... and hope the code finishes before that security guard gets back to the server room on their rounds...."

The code, via Github, can either be accessed via a referee or another remote player. This person then makes whatever amendments they require via GitHub and then 'Commits Changes'.
The act of Committing Changes means that the code being served by the static web page changes meaning that the page is amended. 
This could be amending the displayed message to say "ACCESS GRANTED!" or anything else that is required.

WHAT IS REQUIRED?

  1. Two devices, both with internet access.
  2. One device with access to the GitHub account.
  3. A repository within the GitHub account set up as a Static Web Host.
